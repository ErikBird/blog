Ideas are anti-fragile constructs, similar to those found in natural evolution. They improve when attacked. An idea begins as a very fragile entity that, if it survives its first challenge, can establish itself through certain characteristics. Through further challenges, it then has the opportunity to become good or 'well-thought-out/proven.'

Unfortunately, ideas are parasites - they reside in a mind and live off the host's effort. If the host stops making an effort, the idea often dies, especially if it hasn't fully matured yet. Therefore, ideas need energy, time, and opposing pressure to develop. If the host wishes to nurture an idea to maturity, they should optimize their effort over time.

The parasite should receive enough energy to survive all attacks, while the host remains strong and healthy. This creates a symbiosis.
This metaphor effectively captures how ideas evolve and develop through intellectual challenge and sustained effort, much like biological evolution, while requiring a balanced investment of mental resources from their "host."
