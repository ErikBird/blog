I just had the pleasure to watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6Doq2fz81U&ab_channel=StanfordAIClub) on YouTube.

Basically, it described some fundamental rules that were not as crisp to me as it was presented in the video. The rules were the following: 

1. Any public information will become a commodity. Therefore, any private information will become relatively more valuable for the information owner. So from a perspective of today, that means that all public information will decrease in value generally, and just some small of your unique information will increase in value. For example, a consultant will not be able to make money off any information that is public right now, but needs to sell private information because the AI will be as good as the consultant with the public information, and its only assets are the private information in the future.

2. AI will solve all tasks that are easy to verify or can be made easy to verify. That also means that AI will always have trouble competing with humans on tasks that are not easy to verify and we have trouble to make them verifiable. 

3. Intelligence will not penetrate all areas of life similarly fast. The capability and the rate of improvement are fundamentally dependent on the nature of the task. Questions that give us an intuition on the learnability of a tasks are:

* Is it difficult for humans?
* Is it digital?
* Is it easy to create/access data about it?
* Is there a simple/single heuristic with which we can measure the task success 

I think these three rules are quite easy to grasp, but make for quite good tools to project the AI influence in your domain of interest in the future.
