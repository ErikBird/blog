# The AI/Logic Sandwich: Navigating Optimization in Software Design

My journey of understanding software design began with a simple observation: an increasing trend of solutions that process input data through statistical and AI techniques, transforming them into structured formats for explicit logical processing.

## The AI/Logic Sandwich Paradigm

Consider a typical Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system:

- User input arrives in a diverse, unstructured form
- A traditional, logic-oriented database query system processes this input
- An AI then queries the system, incorporating the database information into its response

This approach represents what I call the "AI/Logic Sandwich" â€“ a method of layering artificial intelligence between logical processing stages.

## Inspiration from Gardening and Natural Growth

[Ankit Maloo's blog post on the "Bitter Lesson"](https://ankitmaloo.com/bitter-lesson/) introduced a compelling gardening analogy that resonated deeply with me. Just as gardeners provide basic ingredients and allow plants to grow naturally, there's a philosophy of minimal intervention in system design and harmony.

### The Darwinian Optimization Challenge

However, a critical difference emerged in my thinking: plants have an inherent, optimized survival objective. They instinctively know their growth trajectory. In contrast, artificially created software lacks this naturally evolved purpose.

This fundamental lack of a Darwinian optimization limits the analogy in some extend.

## The Limits of Iterative Optimization

Darwinian processes enable iterative strategy optimization, but with a crucial caveat: the resulting strategy is merely the best among available alternatives, not necessarily the absolute optimal solution.

Yet, some domains have already developed precise computational methods:

- Geometric properties can be explicitly and optimally computed
- Approximation approaches are inherently less efficient and more expensive
- Expert industry knowledge provides near-optimal representations that can guide software creation

## The Future of Software Design

The exciting prospect lies in growing solutions around these structured, near-optimal representations. As our understanding deepens, building sophisticated software will become increasingly streamlined.

## Key Implication

In the era of AI revolution, a competitive advantage can be achieved by the incorporation of explicit, well-structured industry knowledge.The ability to capture and leverage near-optimal domain understanding will be a critical moat for exceptional software development.
