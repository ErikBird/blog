In traditional sciences, researchers try to apply laws discovered in celestial physics to other fields. This is convenient because these laws are comprehensible, predictable, and verifiable. However, the world is complex, and we always lack measurements of some influencing factors, meaning the mathematics almost never matches exactly.

Therefore, by aggregating these events, we attempt to make meaningful observations from a broader perspective. This is called statistics, which remains predictable and verifiable but is often counterintuitive. It's important to note that this mathematical approach stems from trying to explain the world â€“ statistics is the realization that we cannot achieve this at an atomic level for many real-world problems.
Neural computations approach this from the opposite direction. Scientists observed that the brain is quite capable of making decisions at an atomic level in a complex world. Instead of acting as architects, they now attempt to replicate this process through reverse engineering.

As this new philosophy yields success and gains wider adoption, political disagreements arise because people have traditionally been shaped by the architect's worldview. Many find it difficult to abandon this mathematical certainty and accept a "unpredictable but learning" machine.
