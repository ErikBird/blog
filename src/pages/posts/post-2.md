In traditional sciences, researchers try to apply laws discovered in celestial physics to other fields. This is convenient because these laws are comprehensible, predictable, and verifiable. However, the world is complex, and we always lack measurements of some influencing factors, meaning the mathematics almost never matches exactly.

Therefore, by aggregating these events, we attempt to make meaningful observations from a broader perspective. This is called statistics, which remains predictable and verifiable but is often counterintuitive. It's important to note that this mathematical approach stems from trying to explain the world â€“ statistics is the realization that we cannot achieve this at an atomic level for many real-world problems.

Neural computations approach this from the opposite direction. Scientists observed that the brain is quite capable of making decisions at an atomic level in a complex world.
By remaining the atomic view, they aggregate impressions of patterns that occur to them and optimize their internal models for any inference they might make.
Instead of acting as architects and try to understand the world, they now only try to replicate the consequences of the world that is projected onto them as atoms.
This approach is quite successful and at the same time radically different from traditional sciences.
It optimizes from the bottom up, it optimizes the atomic view.

Furthermore, this approach enables to aggregate various "atomic simulations" and by this enables to approximate the world in some fields better than the traditional sciences ever had.

In my personal opinion, I have the impression that people who are deeply shaped by the traditional sciences currently have a quite hard time to adapt the new philosophy.
Finally, we will probably see a convergence of both approaches in the future.
Pattern, that have been found useful by the worldview of the traditional sciences will become more and more integrated into the atomic view of artificial intelligence and vice versa.
And it will be great!
