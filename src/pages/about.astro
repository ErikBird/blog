            <p>Hi there! I'm delighted you've found your way here.
              This blog is a place where I dump my thoughts and reflections and try to keep me in the habit of writing.
            </p>
            <p>I am generally interested in various topic, ranging from technological developments to the philosophy or the economic structure of society.
            Furthermore, I am living in the "start-up world" and love to create beautiful new products. Hence I might slip some management related posts here and there.
            </p>
            <p>As I am aware that these topics are quite unrelated, I give you filter to not be bothered.</p>
            <p>I hope you find something interesting here.</p>
            <p>If you have any questions, remarks or just want to say hi, please feel free to contact me via <wired-link href="mailto:blog@erik-schwan.com">email</wired-link>.
            </p>
